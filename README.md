# Welcome to Data Pro Ducks,

the best Slack community for Data Pros *to gather, question, and share* their expertise in building data products.

## It’s time to unite.

It’s not easy being a Data Pro building data products, but it is definitely more fun with friends. At Data Pro Ducks (#DataProDucks), we want to create the best place to meet other people just like us.

We do not need to explain what we do and why. It is just about a great community to get advice and accolades and dive into the details of our everyday data problems. That’s why you’ll find experts, memes, and even more industry know-how in our dedicated Slack channel, not a single sales rep. Questions?

### **OUR MISSION**

# To bring like-minded data pros together.

In the beginning, Data Pro Ducks was just a couple of enthusiasts sharing how they build data products at their organisation on LinkedIn. Over time, more friends joined, more expertise was shared, and one day, a small group of enthusiasts transformed into a large group of enthusiastic data experts, calling a dedicated Slack group home for career advice, Q&As, and more.

Today, we’re proud to say that Data Pro Ducks is a community full of the most brilliant, most helpful people in the data space building products.

## A helpful place to solve everyday problems.

What started as a small group of enthusiasts solving data product challenges is becoming a global movement.

# We ask that you follow a few simple rules.

### No solicitation or selling.

To maintain an honest and open space for all members,

we have a zero-tolerance policy for selling or pitching your products or ideas.

### Share openly and often.

Data Pro Ducks is a place to learn from others and help them to grow.

Contribute your ideas and knowledge, elevate helpful conversations, and be a champion for others’ work, findings, and content when it is of value to the community.

### Be respectful of other members.

Everybody is at a different step in their data journey.

Every question is valid and valuable. Use your comments as an opportunity to help others grow. Always be supportive!

### Protect our place and keep it tidy.

Many of us already spend our days sifting through chaos, so don’t let our community channels go the way of an overburdened data warehouse.

Make it easy to discover new learnings by directing all conversations to the correct channel.

### Engage with the community.

You’re a Data Pro with a wealth of knowledge… show it off!

Register as a member on LinkedIn, lend some insight into the Slack group or help somebody find their next adventure.

### The “Rodrigo Clause”.

Some posts may not technically violate a particular rule but don’t feel right in our community. Some things aren’t relevant, and we’re careful to avoid exclusionary language or divisive opinions that don’t serve our community.

We may remove posts that we feel risk the quality of Data Pro Ducks.
